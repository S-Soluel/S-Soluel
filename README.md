- My majors are data analytics and computer science, and I have a minor in actuarial science. 
- The coding languages that I have experience with currently are Python, Java, R, SAS, and MySQL. Additionally, I have two projects that I am currently working on this semester. The first is a group project for a capstone course, and the second project is for my current workplace.
